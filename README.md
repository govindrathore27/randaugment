# randaugment
In this article, I discussed about the UDA i.e., unsupervised data augmentation, its need, its benefits, intuition and various techniques used in this approach. The basic idea behind this approach is to add some sort of noise in input data or the hidden states without changing the labels so as to create more data for training. We focus on consistency training which basically means we want to make our model invariant to nominal noise additions.
